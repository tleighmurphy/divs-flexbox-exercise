               <p>I was born and raised in Chicago, though I have lived in many other cities. I went to college in Boston and Madrid, worked in the food and wine industry in New York City and San Francisco, got married and started my family back in Chicago. For over a decade now I have called Scottsdale, AZ home. </p>

            <div class="div-2">
                <p>My passion: I LOVE taking trips with my husband and teen sons. Exploring new places and finding sights was an interest of mine that began when I backpacked through Europe after college graduation. It is so fun to get to experience travel adventures now while taking road trips to exciting and sometimes obscure places with my family.</p>

            <div class="div-3">
                <p>A fun fact: As a way to make wine less intimidating to people I created and sold a wine-tasting themed board game, called Winerd. It sold nationwide (then later globally) for over a decade. I believe it was the most successful wine themed board game ever. Due to customer demand, I also created BeerNerd, which sold out within weeks of its market debut. </p>
